Project Name: Life Organizer
Context: The app is fully containerized in Docker. It includes a completed Task Management section and a placeholder Notes section. The app is for personal use and runs locally.

IMPORTANT SYSTEM RULES:

Do not alter the Task Management section:

This includes its frontend layout, backend routes, Postgres database tables, and any JavaScript or Python logic related to tasks.

Task-related bugs may still be fixed, but no features should be changed or removed while working on Notes.

Scope of Work â€“ Notes Section:

The Notes section is being developed from scratch.

It will use a new table(s) in the existing Postgres database, connected only via user_id.

It should use a modular structure and be confined to its own route(s), component(s), and schema(s).

Frontend UI Rules:

Common elements like the navbar and header must remain untouched.

Changes should be scoped to the main content area.

Version Control Discipline:

Commit messages should include [NOTES] prefix.

Avoid modifying or deleting any file or code block that clearly belongs to the Task Management section unless it's a critical bug fix.

Testing Discipline:

After each major change to Notes, manually test Task Management for regressions before pushing.

Development Goals for Notes:

Whiteboard-style flexible notes interface.

Support for text (including bullets and numbered lists).

Ability to draw and display basic graphs (line, bar, etc.).


Seamless transition from Task section to Notes in UX flow.
